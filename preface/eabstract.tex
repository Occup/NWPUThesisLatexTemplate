Solar sensor has been widely used as the most important sensor in satellite attitude
determination and control system. Various types of solar sensors have also been developed
to meet different application requirements.
With the continuous innovation in the design and application of micro-nano satellites, 
the need for each specific link in designing and manufacturing to form specific operational
standards has become more urgent.

This paper summarizes the development status and major technical indicators of solar sensors
applicable to microsatellites at this stage, lists the specific products for this research
project at the current stage, and analyzes and summarizes some of the calibration strategies
and experimental methods proposed by the former. With the analysis of quadrant-analogue sun sensors,
this paper also completes the experiment of calibration and operating standards of calibration experiment.

Generally speaking, the accuracy of ordinary analog sun sensors is not high, and the anti-interference
ability is weak. This paper studies the design ideas and working principles of the original analog four-quadrant
solar sensors, and discusses the measurement of four-quadrant sun sensors in depth. The source of the error was
analyzed quantitatively, and the error calibration formula was deduced to propose a measurement calibration
method for the solar sensor with characteristics of small size, low power consumption, large angle of view, 
and high accuracy, which made it have a higher measurement accuracy so that it can fully meet the requirements
of various applications of microsatellites.
